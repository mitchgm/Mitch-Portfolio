# Project Description 

In the 2nd challenge of the bootcamp, I set out to make myself a coding portfolio. The portoflio should reflect who I am as a person, as well as my work as a developer. The website as a contact me form, where a potential employeer could send me an email using a submission form. My projects are also on display, with clickable images as well as my reume in a clickable PDF file.  

# Installation 

To view the project, clone the git repository using VS Code. this will allow you to vie the index.html file ass well as the css style file. The website can be view by right clicking in the index.html file and opening via web browser.

# User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
