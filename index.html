                Hello! My name is Mitch Marena. I am currently a Transportation Analyst at Amazon, as well as a student at the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. Born and raised in Wethersfield, Connecticut, I attended Bowling Green State University (BGSU) in Ohio for my bachelors degree in Managment Information Systems (MIS). Outside of work I enjoy watching old movies, playing ultimate frisbee, playing Xbox, watching College Football, and hanging out with my foster dogs. I have not missed a BGSU football game since I enrolled and it is truly one of my biggest passions!
            </p>

            </div> 
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
                As an employee, I am a critical thinker who uses all the resources at my disposal to problem solve. I have been told in my performance reviews by past employers that I am hard working, detail oriented, as well as a leader to my team and others. At my current role, my biggest accomplishment was spear-heading the new hire training curriculum update for the entire North American Region. This was outside of my regular workflow and was regognized by my Regional Director at our year-end review. I enjoy helping my teammates succeed and creating a new hire curriculum allowed incoming employees to have a better understanding of our team and get working on their own faster with superior knowledge. I also proud myself on being an uplifting team member that brightens everybod's day and will imrpove upon the workplace culture.
